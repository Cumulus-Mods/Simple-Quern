# Simple Quern

Simple Quern is a mod for Minecraft 1.16.2 that adds a simple version of ore doubling in the form of the quern.

### Roadmap
- [ ] Replace LibCD with https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/pull/1075
- [ ] Turn the quern into a block entity renderer with rotation animation on use
    - [ ] Allow the handstone in the block to correspond with the handstone in the quern
- [ ] Rewrite the recipe deserializer with Codecs
    - [ ] Rewrite the recipes to use loot tables
- [ ] Allow the handstones to be enchanted with efficiency and fortune
